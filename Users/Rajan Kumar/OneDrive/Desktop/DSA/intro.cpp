it is nothing but storage of data in sorted order

sorting technique  
is depend on two parameters 
1. Execution time of a program
2. space taken by the program

sorting can be performing using several technique or methods some are follows
1.Bubble sort 
2.Insertion sort
3.Selection sort
4.Quick sort
5.Merge sort
